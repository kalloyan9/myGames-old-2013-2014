Hello! If you are reading this so you are intrested in my HTML5/Javascript browser "games".
They were made when I was *13-15y. old* (2013-2015).
I was a big *enthusiast* but only a *kid* so don't judge me.

Controls in most cases are the arrows, W, A, S, D, space-bar, mouse and mouse buttons.
I have some projects that I am almost proud of, I also have bad projects.

Thanks!

**To play just simply clone the repo on your machine and open html file of each game in your browser.**
